Basel collateral optimization
Banks need to maintain capital for the risky assets and loans in the balance sheet. As banks continues to grow their asset book, the risk in the balance sheet increases and hence the capital needed. Capital is expensive and hence it is imperative for banks to keep the capital charge requirements at an optimal level. In their pursuit to keep the capital deployed for risky assets low, banks seek financial collaterals to partly secure the loans provided to counterparties. Borrowers typically may have mutliple loans from a bank (say term loan, working capital, letters of credit etc) and they offer multiple collaterals to secure the borrowings. The relationship between borrowings and collaterals is many to many. This program seeks to optimize the capital requirements for a counterparty who has many loans availed from a bank for which the borrower has provided multiple collaterals.

The mathematical problem here is a constrained linear optimization model . We will solve this using optimization techniques available in the Sci py lib
